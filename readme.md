## App Description
Hej Hej is a fun, simple full-stack Javascript app for studying Swedish vocabulary and grammar.

## MVP User Stories
As a user, I can play a flashcard game with randomly generated cards from a pre-existing database of Swedish words. Words will consist of the type of speech, the tense (if applicable), an image, the English translation, and conjugations.

The flashcards will either display an image or text, and the user will be enter the translation into an input field. If the translation is correct, they can continue on to the next card and they get a point. If not, their score resets to zero and the game restarts. 

As a user, I can log in to create, read, update, and destroy the vocabulary words. My profile will keep track of my progress, listing high scores (perhaps using Chart.js), listening external educational resources, and possibly displaying the weather/Instagrams/radio/headlines in Stockholm.
